# Protein Structure Prediction using ESM2

This repository contains a Streamlit application that integrates the ESMFfold model by invoking the ESM2 API to predict protein structures based on user-provided protein sequences.

## Description

The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface to quickly obtain accurate protein structure predictions from the ESMFold model. Users enter a protein sequence directly into the Streamlit app, and the app interacts with the ESM2 API to fetch and display the predicted structure.

## Features
- **ESMFold API Integration:** Provides accurate predictions of protein structures.
- **Interactive Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction and real-time prediction.


## Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit app using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

A browser window will open automatically. Enter your protein sequence to obtain the predicted structure.

## Project Files
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application.
